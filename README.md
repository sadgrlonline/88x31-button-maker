# 88x31 Button Maker

## What it is

This is a little generator that can make you a customized 88x31 button! You can change the text alignment, background, text color and border.

I felt spicy one day so I added a 'retro mode' that mimics the old look of the classic gray buttons.

## How it works

This was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses functions and DOM events (such as a live preview and the ability to upload a background image). I am also using [DOM-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image) to create a downloadable image from DOM elements.

## Background

This was one of my first real Javascript projects! I have re-written it countless times since then, lol. It was originally created with jQuery (which helped TREMENDOUSLY with me learning Javascript in general). I loved how jQuery allowed you to quickly 'make cool things' in a way that fuels further curiosity and hunger for creating.

I wanted to make this because I couldn't find any button makers that worked super well or made designs that I was happy with. I made my button in a graphics editor but I wished it was just a little easier to make a quick button!

Feel free to use, adapt, and build upon! I hope to make some minor improvements in the future as well.
